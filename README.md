## League reflection

### Before Wood 2
The game bring to wood 2 by following the step by step tutorial, correcting the tiny error, and modifying the trust value so I'll skip that part and directly begin  explaination and reasoning at Wood 2.

### From Wood 2
* My first step as stated in 14/12/2012 was to work on my base code architecture in order to make the code evolve faster afterwards
* Simply including the algorithm tip provided by Coding games allowed me to pass to Wood 1, no much reflection there, simply add to add that part on my code architecture

### From Wood 1
* With access to BOOST, I've trivially enough add it to the code, ensuring the boost is available and that a certain distance (quite arbitrary, I set it to 100) is separating our pod to the next checkpoint in order to not waste boost

## Timeline

### 13/12/2012 : (~20 min)
* Create the git repository and Readme structure
* Start the codingame project and reached Wood 2 following the tutorial

### 14/12/2012 : (~1h20)
* I've been working on the code architecture, creating various classes as "Pod", "Checkpoint", "Strategy", etc... in order to continue with a clean and evolutive base
* Ensuring that the project is still working as expected, testing the code but without working on beating the Wood 2 boss for the moment
* Some research on C++ features I had forgotten or never really work with like pointer to member-function
